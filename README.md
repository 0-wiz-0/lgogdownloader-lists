This repository contains some lists used by [LGOGDownloader](https://github.com/Sude-/lgogdownloader).

## game_has_dlc.txt

game_has_dlc.txt is a list of [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) games that have DLC.
This is a workaround for problem caused by GOG reporting wrong DLC count information for many games.
This list lets lgogdownloader know which games have dlc and should have their DLC count information ignored.
The list uses the same format as blacklist in lgogdownloader.

## covers.xml

covers.xml is a list of user made cover images for [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) games.
